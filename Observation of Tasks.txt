**************
Observation
**************
Task 3a) - Data visualization of all the attributes provided in the dataset.


Task 3b) - 
--->The amount of time that employees spend working for a company is inversely correlated with the frequency of workplace accidents.
--->According to this observation, there is a correlation between employee tenure and a decreased risk of workplace accidents. 
--->In other words, employees with longer tenure appear to have a reduced probability of being engaged in workplace accidents than those with shorter tenure.

Task 3c) -
---> Employees who have received promotions in the last five years tend to have a low level of job satisfaction. 
--->This indicates that there is a connection between the number of promotions given during this period and the employees' dissatisfaction with their jobs.

Task 3d) -
---> The job satisfaction of employees shows a positive correlation with their latest evaluation scores. 
---> As both attributes increase, the connection becomes stronger. This suggests that employees' job satisfaction levels tend to rise as their evaluation scores improve. 
---> In other words, those with higher evaluation scores are more likely to report greater job satisfaction compared to those with lower evaluation scores.

Task 3e) - 
---> There is a positive correlation between the number of projects employees work on and their average monthly working hours. 
--->Initially, the relationship appears to be denser, but over time, it becomes less pronounced or sparse.

--->This finding suggests that employees who are engaged in more projects tend to work longer hours on average than those with fewer projects. 
--->Alternatively, it could indicate that as the number of projects assigned to individuals increases, so does their average monthly working hours.

Task 3f) - 
--->There is very little noticeable difference in the frequency of promotions over the last five years among employees in the low, medium, and high wage categories.
--->This indicates that individuals across all income brackets have a similar likelihood of receiving promotions. 
--->In other words, employees with low wages are just as likely to have been promoted in the past five years as those with medium or high salaries.
